  <!-- By default Liquibase generates an update script with updateSQL command which includes all
    update types, i.e. tables, views, procedures etc and at the same time does not separate
    procedure statements with delimiters. This works when updates are automatic on server start, but
    does not work with manual updates via updateSQL command. If we are to include manual delimit statements
    in procedures then the reverse is true, the server does not start with automatic updates but
    the valid sql file is generated with updateSQL command.
    So here we have a workaround, such that by default we include commented out delimit statements which are just
    SQL comments and don't do anything, which works for automatic updates, and we 'uncomment' these statements
    when generating manual update SQL with out utility script

  <property name="delimiter.start"  value="-- delimiter placeholder DELIMITER |" dbms="mysql"/>
  <property name="delimiter.end"    value="-- delimiter placeholder |" dbms="mysql"/>
  <property name="delimiter.reset"  value="-- delimiter placeholder DELIMITER ;" dbms="mysql"/>
